Welcome to the share workspacce!

Couple things:
	-Please set up your Github account
	-Install Git to your local machine
	-Create your own a development branch for the project (name_dev). That way you won't mess up with the master.
	-Feel free to upload your files, datas, or models on your dev branch. If you want it to be merge to the master branch, you just need to submit a pull reuqest on Github

All the Best!
